<p></p>

Yorgos Stavridis is exploring the inherent sound potential of percussion, objects and electronic media through making, on-site action and improvisation. His music practice focuses on gesture, texture and timbre within a spatial, perceptual and physical approach, while addressing the relations between activities of listening, improvising and composing as inseparably connected and reciprocal.  
He is a member of the experimental music group Trigger Happy and of KeDiMouRa; a music collective focusing on playful and collaborative methods of music-making, currently developing the online radio station Loskop.radio. He has performed at numerous festivals and venues along Greece and Europe. He graduated from the Music Department of the Ionian University and the Master's program Contemporary Performance and Composition.
